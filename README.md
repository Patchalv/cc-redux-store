# CC Redux Store

This app was completed as part of the Codecademy Full-stack Engineering bootcamp to practice using the Redux state management library. The redux store displays products from the Codecademy store, and allows users to browse items, add them into the cart which updates depending on the quantity and price of the item.In the cart, the user can adjust the quantity of each item and the running total will be displayed at the bottom. Lastly, the user can choose the currency for the entire application.

The objective of this project were to: 

- Complete the cartâ€™s action creators and reducer logic
- Create the store using createStore() and combineReducers()
- Pass the store resources to presentational components via the top-level <App /> component
- Render the <Cart /> component using the current state data
- Dispatch actions to the store
